# Baseline Model

**[Notebook](baseline_model.ipynb)**

## Baseline Model Results

### Model Selection
- **Baseline Model Type:** [e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.]
- **Rationale:** [Brief explanation of why this model was chosen as baseline]

### Model Performance
- **Evaluation Metric:** [e.g., Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall, MSE, MAE, R², etc.]
- **Performance Score:** [e.g., 85% accuracy, F1-score of 0.78, MSE of 0.15]
- **Cross-Validation Score:** [Mean and standard deviation of CV scores, e.g., 0.82 ± 0.03]

### Evaluation Methodology
- **Data Split:** [Train/Validation/Test split ratios, e.g., 70/15/15]
- **Evaluation Metrics:** [List all metrics used and justify why they are appropriate for this problem]

### Metric Practical Relevance
[Explain the practical relevance and business impact of each chosen evaluation metric. How do these metrics translate to real-world performance and decision-making? What do the metric values mean in the context of your specific problem domain?]

## Next Steps
This baseline model serves as a reference point for evaluating more sophisticated models in the [Model Definition and Evaluation](../3_Model/README.md) phase.
